### Introduction to Incident Response
Incident Response is the structured process an organisation follows to detect, contain, investigate, and recover
from cybersecurity incidents.
### Incident Response Frameworks
1. NIST Incident Response Plan
   - Preparation
   - Detection and Analysis
   - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
   - Post-Incident Activity
2. SANS Incident Response Plan
   - Preparation
   - Identification
   - Containment
   - Eradication
   - Recovery
   - Lessons Learned<br>

### Identification
- Identification Sources
   - Network perimeter
   - Email perimeter
   - Host perimeter
   - Threat intel
   - User Entity and Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)
- Alert Tuning
   - Alert fatigue
   - Signal-to-noise ratio
- Incident Prioritisation
   - Incident triage
   - Incident scope
   - Urgency, criticality, impact
- Documentation
   - Ticket, report
- Communication and Notification
   - Notify relevant parties

### Containment
- Short-term Containment
   - Quarantine, isolation
   - Isolating networks
   - Taking down systems
   - Network filters and rules
   - Killing processes
   - Temporal patches
- Business Impact
   - Plain containment measure
- Long-term Containment
   - Stabilise the environment while rebuilding a clean system
   - Removing the attacker's access
   - Traffic segmentation,br>

### Eradication
- Remove the attacker's system and network artefacts
- Restoring systems
- Manually removing artefacts
- Improving defence<br>

### Recovery
- Get affected systems back into production
  - Restore systems
  - Remove artefacts
- Confirm Functionality
   - Functionality testing
- Prevent future Incidents
   - Hardening, scanning, monitoring
