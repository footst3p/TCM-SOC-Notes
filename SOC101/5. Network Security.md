### Network Security Theory
**Network Layer Protocols**
1. Internet Protocol (IP): This is the fundamental communication protocol that facilitates the transmission of data packets across network.
It falls into the network layer.
  - IP Addressing: A unique numerical lable assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the internrt protocol        for its communication.
  - IP Routing: How data packets are directed from the source to destination across the network.

2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): It provides reliable communication across devices on a network.
    - Connection-orientaed - reliable.
    - Three-way handshake.
    - Flow and congestion control.

3. User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
    - Connectionless-oriented.
    - Lightweight, low-overhead - speed over reliability.
    - VOIP, video and audio streaming.

### The Three-way Handshake
An underline process that established a reliable connection between two devices over a network.
