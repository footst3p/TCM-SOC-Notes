### Network Security Theory
**Network Layer Protocols**
1. Internet Protocol (IP): This is the fundamental communication protocol that facilitates the transmission of data packets across network.
It falls into the network layer.
  - IP Addressing: A unique numerical lable assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the internrt protocol        for its communication.
  - IP Routing: How data packets are directed from the source to destination across the network.

2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): It provides reliable communication across devices on a network.
    - Connection-orientaed - reliable.
    - Three-way handshake.
    - Flow and congestion control.

3. User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
    - Connectionless-oriented.
    - Lightweight, low-overhead - speed over reliability.
    - VOIP, video and audio streaming.

### The Three-way Handshake
An underline process that established a reliable connection between two devices over a network.

  `SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK`

### Common Ports:
1. 21 - File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Transfer files between systems.
2. 22 - Secure Shell (SSH): Secure remote connection.
3. 23 - Telnet: Unencrypted remote connection.
4. 25 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMPT): Sending emails.
5. 53 - Domain Name System (DNS): Translating domain names into IP addresses.
6. 80 - HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Data communication over the web.
7. 110 - Post Office Protocol (POP3): Receiving emails.
8. 135 - Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC): Microsoft inter-process communication.
9. 139 - NetBIOS: Windows file and printer sharing.
10. 143 - Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): Syncronising emails.
11. 389 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (IDAP): Centralized directory and authentication service.
12. 443 - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTP with encypted communication.
13. 445 - Server Message Block (SMB): Network file and printing sharing.
14. 3389 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): Graphical interface to connect with a remote system.
15. 8080 - HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Alternative or proxy for HTTP traffic.

### Packet Capture Analysis
Packet: A unit of data that is transmitted between device on a network. It includes, Header, Payload, and Trailer.

### Packet Capture (PCAP)
1. Intercepting Packet:
   - Port mirroring (SPAN ports)
   - Inline network devices
   - Network taps
  
2. PCAP Files: Binary file format that includes a header and raw payload.

3. Network Interface: A point of communication between a computer and a network.
   
### Introduction to TCPDUMP
A command-line packet analyzer.

Viewing all network interface:
`ip link show`

Listing available network interfaces
`tcpdump -D`
Packet capture through an interface:
`sudo tcpdump -i lo`
`sudo tcpdump -i lo -X`
`sudo tcpdump -i lo -A`
Capturing Network Traffic
`sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n host example.com`
`sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n src 10.15.0.1`
`sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n dst 10.18.0.1`
`sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n port 21`
`sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n 'src 10.15.0.1 and not port 22'`

Reading a PCAP file
`tcpdump -r filename.pcap`
