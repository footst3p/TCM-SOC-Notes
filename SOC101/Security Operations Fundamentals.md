### **The SOC and its Roles**
SOC = Security Operations Center.
A Security Operations Center is a centralised unit within an organisation that deals with security issues, incidents, and events.

### **Stages**
1. Monitor:
   - Continuous watching for unusual activity.
   - Utilisation of monitoring tools (SIEM, IDS, etc.).
   - Early detection of potential security threats.
  
2. Detect:
   - Confirm security events identified during monitoring.
   - Utilise threat detection techniques.
   - Identify known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  
3. Analyse:
   - Perform in-depth investigations to understand security incidents.
   - Examine affected systems, build a timeline of events.
   - Trace tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
  
4. Respond:
   - Formulate a response plan based on findings.
   - Contain threats, mitigate impact, and restore normal operations.
   - Collaborate with internal teams and stakeholders.
  
### **What Makes Up a SOC**
1. People: Personnel who work in SOC, like Analysts, Responders, Engineers, etc.
2. Process: IR plans, Playbooks, etc.
3. Technology: SIEM, IDS, EDR, etc.

### **Key Functions of a SOC**
The functions are divided into two (Reactive and Proactive)

### **Reactive Functions:**
Perform in response to cybersecurity incidents as they occur.

1. Monitoring and Detection:
   - Network and system logs, alerts.
   - SIEM, IDS, Log analysis.
   - Alert triage
  
2. Incident Response:
   - Investigate, contain, and mitigate threats.
   - Collect evidence and artefacts.
   - Engage with stakeholders.
  
3. Forensics Analysis:
   - In-house or third-party.
   - Determine cause and scope.
   - Preserve evidence and engage legal.
  
4. Malware Analysis:
   - Sandbox and reverse engineering malware.
   - Study malware behaviours.
   - Collect indicators of compromise.
  
### **Procative Functions:**
Perform to prevent cybersecurity incidents before they occur or mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

1. Threat Intelligence:
   - Gather and analyse intelligence.
   - Study emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
   - Feed intel detection tools for proactive depose.
  
2. Threat Hunting:
   - Search for malicious activities or intrusions.
   - Log, network traffic, endpoint telemetry.
   - Utilise threat intelligence to hunt for known indicators.
  
3. Vulnerability Management:
   - Identify and address vulnerability.
   - Scan, assess, and patch.
   - Coordinate remediation activity.
  
4. Security Awareness Training:
   - Promote security awareness within the organisation.
   - Educate best practices, policies, procedures.
   - Mitit=gate human error leading to incidents.
  
### **A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst**
1. Rotating schedules (sometimes).
2. Alert triage.
3. First-line analyst and investigation.
4. Document and reporting.
5. Escalation and collaboration
6. Continuous improvement and cross-training.
