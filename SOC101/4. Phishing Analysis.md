4. Social proof: Validate legitimacy through consensus.
5. Urgency: Act NOW!
6. Scarcity: Instill a fear of missing out.
7. Familiarity: Establish credibility through recognition.

# Email Fundamentals:
1. Email Headers: Lines of metadata attached to an email and contain many useful strings of information for analysts, and investigators.
2. Email Body: The main content of the email.
3. Email Addresses: Unique address assigned to individual to send and receive emails.
4. Email Protocols: Roles that governs how emails are sent.

   - POP3 Post Office Protocol version 3 (110): Used forreceiving emails.
   - IMAP (143): Synchronisation of emails.
5. Mail Agent:
   - Mail Transfer Agent (MTA): Route and transfer email message across email server.
   - Mail User Agent (MUA): Compose, send, receive, and manage emails. e.g. Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Thunderbird,etc.
   - Mail Delivery Agent (MDA): Accepting incoming email messages from MTAs.
   - Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
   - Mail Retrieval Agent (MRA)

# Email Analysis Methodology
1. Initial Triage: Quickly assess and prioritise.
2. Header and Sender Examination:
   - Investigate MTAs, addresses, IPs,etc.
   - Identify the true origin and check authenticity.
3. Content Examination:
   - Analyse email content for language, formatting, etc.
   - Look for social engineering red flags.

   - Securely extract and analyse attachments.
   - Checking file reputation and sanboxing.
6. Contectual Examination:
   - Consider broader context, or current incidents.
   - Look forpatterns and assess scope.
7. Defense Measure:
   - Take reactive defense action (if needed)
   - Take proactive defense actions.
   - Communicate with users and stakeholders.
8. Documentaton and Reporting:
   - Maintain records of findigs, verdicts, and actions taken through detailed report.
   - Close out alerts and tickets.

# Email Authentication Methods
1. Sender Policy Framework (SPF): A mechanism that allows domain owners to specify which mail server are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain.

   Checking for SPF records for domain manually:
   
   `nslookup -type=txt shodan.io | grep -i spf`
   or
   
   `dig TXT shodan.io | grep -i spf`

2. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): An email authentication method that helps prevent email spoofing by allowing a sending domain to digitally sign outbound emails.

Online tool: https://mxtoolbox.com/dkim.aspx
